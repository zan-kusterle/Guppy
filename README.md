# Guppy

Unless you are a professional DJ, chances are at some point you have had party guests over that get on your case for your taste in music. Everyone has their own preferences and no one wants to be left off the playlist. Guppy for Android ensures they never have to by letting everyone on a Bluetooth connection contribute. Setup is simple and straightforward. One person in a group hosts a playlist and everyone else contributes to it. All participants will need to have the application downloaded and installed on their phones. Users can add YouTube links to the playlist and the songs will be played in the order they were added. This means that the host will need to have an active internet connection. Since YouTube is full of good quality music videos and dedicated music channels (such as VEVO), finding a particular song should not be a problem. By using YouTube, we also eliminate the need for syncing songs to the host phone, since not only it would take a lot of time but it would also bring up licensing issues. The host would also be the moderator of the playlist, that means he or she would be able to remove songs from the playlist. It is also possible to open, save and modify already existing playlists.
